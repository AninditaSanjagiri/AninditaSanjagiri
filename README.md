## About Me

I’m a third-year engineering student with a strong interest in **machine learning systems that interact with real users and real constraints**.

I enjoy working across the stack — from data preprocessing and model training to backend logic and thoughtful UI design. My projects often sit at the intersection of **ML, systems thinking, and user experience**.

I’m especially interested in **research-oriented environments** where correctness, clarity, and reproducibility matter more than flashy demos.

## How I Think About Projects

- Start from the **problem and data**, not the model  
- Prefer **clear baselines + honest evaluation** 
- Treat ML models as **part of a system**, not standalone artifacts  
- Document limitations and edge cases explicitly  

> I value understanding *why* something works (or fails) as much as making it work.
